We use [npm] stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code. to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
